    "long": "Numbers Protocol is the Decentralized Provenance Standard. It secures digital media provenance through a decentralized ecosystem and blockchain technology, similar to a version control system like Git. Numbers creates immutable birth records of digital content and tracks changes made, allowing for collaboration and management. The Numbers Mainnet functions as a decentralized Github, storing data related to assets, such as provenance, ownership, and historical records, securely and transparently.\n\nIn the future of AI, provenance ensured by Numbers Protocol can help to provide references of where the data came from and how it should be used. This is important in building trust between individuals and organizations that collect and use personal data, identifying whether the content is generated by AI or not. The Assetization Process further helps users of Numbers Protocol build user-owned and user-controlled content datasets. With proper consent, the registered digital content and their provenance metadata can be used by AI models or other variety of purposes.\n\nOur long-term vision is to establish a transparent, fair, and authentic digital media ecosystem that promotes accountability and ensures the safe and secure use of digital content."
